## Overview
Taste of Russia is a tour agency specializing on exclusive tours to Russia for Australians. The idea came to me a while ago, as an opportunity to start my own business.

## Features
- Full-stack real-world application showcasing skills acquired during the course.
- Back-end: Ruby on Rails, front-end: Bootstrap, DB:Postgres
- TDD: writing tests for Models and Controllers using RSPEC.
- Credit Card Payment processing using Stripe
- Display current temperature info for each city via AJAX and OpenWeather API.
- Responsive design
- Image on homepage and floral pattern background created by me in Adobe Illustrator

## Intended User Flow
User gets to homepage from ad/brochure. They look through featured tours/click on button to start. They go to "All Tours" page, where they can filter through different tours by price, length, cities etc. User can also read testimonies about tours. They can also ask a question to admin about details that are not specified on the info page. They choose the one they like and go to a form to provide their details and complete the payment. They finalize it and receive confirmation of the payment.

Look through the website and actual purchase might occur over multiple visits to the site (time between interest in tour and commitment and decision making).
